## Tasks
### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
* Create a RSA key pair and share the public key
### 1. For Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a for loop
### 2. While Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a while loop
### 3. Until Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using an until loop
### 4. If 9, say Hi!
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using while loop
	* For the 9th iteration, display `Best School` and then `Hi` on a new line
### 5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
* Bash script that loops from 1 - 10 (while loop) and:
	* Displays `bad luck` for the 4th loop iteration.
	* Displays `good luck` for the 8th loop iteration.
	* Displays `Best School` for the other iterations.
