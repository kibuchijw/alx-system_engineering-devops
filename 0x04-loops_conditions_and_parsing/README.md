## Tasks
### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
* Create a RSA key pair and share the public key
### 1. For Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a for loop
### 2. While Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a while loop
### 3. Until Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using an until loop
### 4. If 9, say Hi!
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using while loop
	* For the 9th iteration, display `Best School` and then `Hi` on a new line
### 5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
* Bash script that loops from 1 - 10 (while loop) and:
	* Displays `bad luck` for the 4th loop iteration.
	* Displays `good luck` for the 8th loop iteration.
	* Displays `Best School` for the other iterations.
### 7. Clock
* Bash script that displays the time for 12 hoours and 59 minutes
	* Display hours from 0 - 12
	* Display minutes from 1 - 59
### 8. For ls
* Bash script that displays:
	* Content of the current directory
	* In a list format
	* Only part of the name after the hyphen is displayed
### 9. To file, or not to file
* Bash script that gives you information about the `school` file
	* Bash script should check if file exists and print:
		* If the file exists: `school file exists`
		* If the file does not exist: `school file does not exist`
	* If the file exists, print:
		* If the file is empty: `school file is empty`
		* If the file is not empty: `school file is not empty`
		* If the file is a regular file: `school is a regular file`
		* If the file is not a regular file:(nothing)
### 10. FizzBuzz
* Bash script that displays numbers from 1 - 100
	* Displays `FizzBuzz` when number is a multiple of 3 and 5
	* Displays `Fizz` when number is a multiple of 3
	* Displays `Buzz` when number is a multiple of 5
