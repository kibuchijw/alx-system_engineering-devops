## Tasks
### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
* Create a RSA key pair and share the public key
### 1. For Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a for loop
### 2. While Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using a while loop
### 3. Until Best School loop
* Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times using an until loop
### 4. If 9, say Hi!
